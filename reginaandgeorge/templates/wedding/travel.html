                  <p class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-xs-12">Cited as one of the <a href="http://www.cntraveler.com/galleries/2016-01-06/the-most-beautiful-towns-in-america/14">most beautiful towns in America</a>, Traverse City has turned into a major wedding destination in the last decade. In fact, close to 80% of the weddings held at our wedding venue are of couples from out of state! We couldn't believe how many venues were booking more than a year in advance, and we were fortunate to secure our date of July 15th. What this means for guests is that you will want to <b>book early!</b> Our wedding is the week after Cherry Festival so you shouldn't have to contend with the big crowds; that being said, July is prime time for Traverse City, so rooms and airlines will book fast. Based on our research, you will be able to secure a better deal if you book well in advance.  If you will be flying, the closest airport is Traverse City (TVC), but there are other options (listed below.)  If you are coming from out of town, there are options to stay in either

                            Traverse City Airport is by far the most conveniently located, just minutes away from downtown Traverse City. It has a total of three gates and it's super easy to fly in and out. That said, it can be a bit more expensive to fly here.
